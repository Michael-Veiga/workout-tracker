## Usage

This application allows users to create and modify their own workout plans. Once the page loads, the user will be prompted to make a new workout. When the button is clicked, the user will select the exercise type. The type of exercise that is selected will determine the input fields on the following form. The resistance type will ask the user for an exercise name, weight, number of sets, number of reps and the duration in minutes. The cardio type will ask the user for the cardio name, distance in miles and duration in minutes. Once the user has completed the form, they can add another exercise to their routine. Once all exercises have been added, the user can click the complete button which will redirect them to the stats page. The stats page includes a compounded summary of the entire routine including the number of exercises, performed, distance covered, weight lifted, number of sets performed and number of reps performed.

## Review

Mongo is a lot like sql, so this homework was fairly straightforward. One of the more challenging aspects of this assignment was using validators to make sure that inputted values met the schema parameters. After completing this assignment, i've found that I prefer sql over mongo.
